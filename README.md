# grafana_dashboards
This git repo collects Grafana dashboards for the [ByteBlower GUI](https://setup.byteblower.com/software.html#GUI)

These dashboards are based on the [Open metrics API](https://api.byteblower.com/prometheus). They are based on
a Prometheus backend and the dashboards use Grafana for the graphics.
